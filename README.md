# guitar_hero
An Arduino Project that uses a breadboard with buttons as the "guitar" and another breadboard with LEDs that shifts the light towards the user similar to how the notes come down in guitar hero. When the light progression reaches the bottom set of lights, then the player has to press the buttons with the corresponding colours.
