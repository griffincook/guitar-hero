# guitar_hero
An Arduino Project that used a breadboard with buttons as the "guitar" and another breadboard with LEDs that shifted the light towards the user similar to how the notes come down in guitar hero. Then when the lights reach the bottom, the player has to press the buttons with the corresponding colours.
